# OGraphSearch
Qt application for visualizing graph searches

## Purpose
OGraphSearch provides an easy to use GUI interface for constructing any graph. The app can then visualize searches on the graph using a selected algorithm.

## Use
Can be built by Qt Creator using the project file. The view area can be double clicked to add a node, and placed nodes can be selected by left clicking.

Nodes can be added at a specifix (x,y,z) coordinate using the toolbar on the right. Edges can be added by selecting two nodes in the view area, and clicking the add edge button. If no weight is specified, this defaults to the distance between points.

Clicking the button to delete selected points will delete currently selected points, along with any attached edges.
